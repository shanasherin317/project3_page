            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive <br>of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the <br>qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions<br> eventually meet, in which there is no center because every<br> point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men<br> occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will,<br> be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

            Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for <br>both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science.<br> The early warnings about technological dangers also come <br>from science.

            What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that <br>man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

            A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl<br> who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather<br> than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the <br>first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

            For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the <br>hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the <br>experience most certainly changes your perspective. The <br>things that we share in our world are far more valuable than<br> those which divide us.

            There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ <br>Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the<br> generations. And no matter how much progress one makes,<br> there is always the thrill of just beginning.

            Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one<br> man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which <br>mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of <br>human development.

            As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in <br>size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful<br> you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so<br> fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would <br>crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
